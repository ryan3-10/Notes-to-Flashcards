# Notes-to-Flashcards
This application takes a file or plain text as input, and generates "flashcards" based on the content. The notes need to be in a question-answer format. The user also has the option to toggle "shuffle", which will display the cards in a random order, or to keep the questions in the order that they were in in the original text. Very useful for quizing yourself on upcoming exams. 

Sample text is provided to give an idea of what the algorithm looks for in creating its question and answer cards.

The main downside is that when the notes are not in the proper question-answer format, the program will be unable to create flashcards for them. Ideally it will eventually be able to create questions based off of any type of input, but for now this is where it is at.
